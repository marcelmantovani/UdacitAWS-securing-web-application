# Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The following findings are related to the code deployed in this project:

HIGH	CIS.4.1	Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
HIGH	CIS.4.2	Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
MEDIUM	CIS.4.3	Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic


# Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

HIGH	CIS.4.1	Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
    The remediation steps is either remove rule allowing TCP on port 22 or replace Cidr 0.0.0.0/0 line in c3-app.yml with a list of whitelisted IP addresses.

HIGH	CIS.4.2	Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
    The remediation step is to remove the ingress rule allowing traffic with IpProtocol: -1

MEDIUM	CIS.4.3	Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic
    According to AWS documentation: Security Hub recommends that the default security group restrict all traffic.
    In Cloudformation documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html) "The default rule is removed only when you specify one or more egress rules", which means c3-vpc.yml needs to be modified to have definition of ingress and egress rules on security group to block all traffic - this needs to be done to the default SG and therefore the block should not contain property "GroupName".
